            <h2>Wanna know a bit about me?</h2>
            <p>I am a Virginia Beach native in my second year of college. I am majoring in Graphic Design with an emphasis on Multi-Media. I am 40 years young. Those are some speed dating stats about me, but things were'nt always so clear cut. I am a bit of a grown up kid, so my mischievousness got me into trouble more often than not. It was during troubled times when I first discovered typography as a creative outlet, which led to my interest in design. From that point on, my love of design has only grown stronger. I haven't decided which aspect of design I'm gonna commit all this energy to, but I know for sure my future is in this field. Ultimately, I want to turn my love of design into a career where I can bring ideas to life. What a great feeling it is completing and submitting a project to a nice response.</p>

            <h2>Interactive Design 1 - Spring 2017</h2>
            <p>In this class, I am gaining the skills to develop my own web content and create exciting interactive sites. I'm learning the basics of writing code so that I can further my skills on my own afterwards. Hopefully I can make an honest buck doing what I love. This is all still just me playing with my favorite toys.</p>
