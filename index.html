                <h4>Wanna know a bit about me?</h4>
                <p>I am a Virginia Beach native in my second year of college. I am majoring in Graphic Design with an emphasis on Multi-Media. I am 40 years young. Those are some speed dating stats about me, but things were'nt always so clear cut. I am a bit of a grown up kid, so my mischievousness got me into trouble more often than not. It was during troubled times when I first discovered typography as a creative outlet, which led to my interest in design. From that point on, my love of design has only grown stronger. I have not yet decided which aspect of design I might focus on, but I know for sure my future is in the field of design. Ultimately, I want to turn my love of design into a career where I can bring people's ideas to life. What a great feeling it is completing and submitting a project to  a nice response</p>
