                <li><strong>1. Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
                <p>The fonts used for the introductions and pull quotes is a free-form  flowing script typeface that almost seems as if it is painted by hand. The style of the typeface perfectly evokes the feeling of the artist and the mood established by the body content. The paragraph font is a pretty straight forward serif which seems fine.</p>
                <li><strong>2. Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
                <p>This is the part that struck me before anything else. I absolutely love the way the colors perfectly interact with and tie together the imagery and fonts. The images are full of blues, teels, bermuda bay or sea-foamy hues. The colors are always reminding the viewer of nature and the fluidity of the artist. The colors are setting the tone along with the font and imagery as soon as the site is opened. The colors are often overlaying the images and the background of the document itself.The introduction paragraph even has the font change hues as the site is scrolled, which gives the impression of a tide rolling in or a sky exploring its own spectrum.</p>
                <li><strong>3. What role do the visuals play? When and how are they used?</strong></li>
                <p>I have already discussed the visuals to some degree. The visuals are usually used to cradle the pull quotes and express the body content. They are gifs in the case of this site. They also move the story along in acts of the journey of Panda Bear. He faces the great wide unknown in the beginning. He ventures into it in the middle. He returns back to the shore in the end, which is the final gif we see.</p>
                <li><strong>4. How are sections seperated?What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
                <p>The sections are separated by the images and pull quotes. The cues are the gifs which show the three stages of the site.</p>
