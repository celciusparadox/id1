            <ol>
                <li><strong> Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
                <p>The fonts used for majical cloudz remind me of the way they spell their name.It fits perfectly with middle eastern spelling. The fonts are almost arabic feeling.</p>
                <li><strong> Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
                <p>The colors are also very appropriate. They seem a bit sad and subdued. I think this fits nicely with the vibe of their backstory</p>
                <li><strong> What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used? </strong></li>
                <p>The visuals are mainly used as a type of portrait on each of the members. They are used when breaking up the sections into smaller storyline shifts.</p>
                <li><strong> How are the sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
                <p>The sections are separated by images. There is a backstory section and also a great deal of focus on the group's new music. The visual cues are almost always images, except for two bound pull quotes.</p>
