                    <li>Playful and fun. Not too serious.</li>
                    <li>The navigation is smooth and very clear. Throughout the portfolio she has maintained consistency. It is very easy to go from one item to the next.The pages on her portfolio are about, work, and musings.</li>
                    <li>There is clear hierarchy applied to the intro headers. She has chosen to draw immediate attention to the phrase that sets the tone of the portfolio. I have learned some of the projects she has worked on through the body copy, as well as a bit of her personality through the header phrase.</li>
                    <li>The body copy is a lot smaller in sclae than the main header. She definately does this to set the tone and then gradually go into the information in the body copy. The body copy follows a three column grid layout.</li>
                    <li>The footer is informative and includes the links to important sites of hers, as well as the watermarks of the company.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>The navigation becomes a continuos scroll, and also has a hamburger that contains the page items.</li>
                    <li>The headline text still maintains hierarchal importance.</li>
                    <li>The size of the body text gets larger and more easy to read on a phone I guess. But it still maintains its size in relation to the header. It still is the smallest in scale.</li>
                    <li>The layout is a single column now. All the items in the pages are in a single column.</li>
                    <li>The footer is arranged in a slinder, centered position.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Serious.</li>
                    <li>The layout is geared towards visual keys. The striking images of her workas sort of mock-ups seems very accesable to clients who would be wondering how her design choices look without having to dig too deep into her site. I have learned that she is product oriented mostly.</li>
                    <li>The portfoilio entries are all layed out in a single column format containing smaller sections. Everytime the sections change, the color changes. She places the description after the first image of each section so that we see a section change then an image of the work, and then a description of the work. The project images are smaller and all fit in double columns.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>The introductory section loses its opening image and goes directly into copy about her.</li>
                    <li>The layout of the portfolio entries changes into a single column, but she still uses a change of color to introduce new entries. The project description is always first now. It comes directly after the section changes instead of being beneath the image. She places the images in a smaller single comlumn and then collages them into interesting grids.</li>

            <h3>Desktop + Mobile</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The layout is very interactive in the right side where the portfolio entries are and static where the about me section is.</li>
                <li>The design is minimal. He uses black font on white background. It feels very business like, but the reward is when we float over the portfolio entries.He indicates  hierarchy by using space between the text sections.</li>
                <li>The layout stays the same except for turning into a sinlge column, and now the interactive elements are gone. Now we have to actually click on the entries.</li>
                <li>The size of the text does not seem to change other than getting larger in a relative way.</li>
