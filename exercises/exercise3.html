            <ol>Janelle Monae Website Analysis
                <li><strong>1. Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
                <p>The fonts used for Janelle Monae's site are a bit basic to me but they do mostly express her words in italics, although even that is not reserved entirely for her words. The use of italics is also used when describing her in the introductory diamond that otherwise contains pull quotes. The site title which sort of shifts in sections horizontally when scrolling is a lot more fun.</p>
                <li><strong>2. Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
                <p>The colors are used to show subtlety some times and intensity at others. The colors are also used to show the beginning and ending of certain sections of the site. They fade in, intensify, and fade out as we scroll. I think the geometrical shapes on the title page work well with the contrasting colors and the gradients within the fonts.</p>
                <li><strong>3. What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used? Th pinks and floral hues of the palette are one side of her personality and the black and whites of the geometrical shapes is the other.</strong></li>
                <p>The visuals contain intensified clarity which goes along with the exaggerated geometrical shapes and clean lines of her makeup and fashion style that she is known for.</p>
                <li><strong>4. How are the sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
                <p>The sections are separated by image and pull quotes. There are backstory, plans for the future, and present tense sections. Color change or color intensity cue the changing of the sections.</p>
