        <h1>The State of the World Today!</h1>
        <h3>What do you love about the world?</h3>
        <p>I love the interconnectedness of the world. I love the way that everything is right at our fingertips. Anything we would like to know we can just look up on the internet. I love how we have an accumalative pool of knowledge.</p>
        <h3>What do you hate about the world?</h3>
        <p>I hate that there is so much violence. I hate that people spend more time texting than having actual conversations.</p>
        <h3>What do you wish you could change about the world?</h3>
        <p>I wish I could change the life expectancy of Planet Earth. I would want it to last forever.</p>
