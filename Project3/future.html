            <p>In the state of Virginia, the probation and paroll office tracks adult ex-offenders for up to three years average. During that period , there has proven to be a steady 27-29% of rerarrests within the first 12 months. What is it that brings ex- offenderers back to prison? This is a question that has troubled the commonwealth for a long while.</p>
            <p>I want to ask some ex offenders for their perspective just to see what they recognize as triggers or positive influences. I want to discuss a few topics covering how offenders prepare for success prior to being released. I wonder whether it may come down to pooor planning sometimes. I want to find out if offenders have faith in the tool that the penile system offers. Is it poor support systems maybe?</p></section>
