            <p>When you're an ex-offender there is so much to consider when trying to establish a steady future for yourself. There are employers who can not look past the fact that you are a convicted felon. There are people in the family who see nothing more than the fuck-up they have always seen. And there are the doubts that surely creep into your mind about your own chances for success.</p>
            <p>Rachael, along with countless others are figuring out ways to soar far above what is expected of them. There are hopes of course, coming from family members and loved ones, but there is most often the expectation of failure. I want these three friends of mine to stand as testaments of success. They are not what everyone expected of them, and they are not prisoners of their pasts.</p><p>Return to home page<a href="Projectthree.html" class="fun"> here.</a></p></section>
