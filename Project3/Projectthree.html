            <h2>The Vicious Cycle</h2>
            <p>In the state of Virginia, the probation and parole office tracks adult ex-offenders for up to three years average. During that period , there has proven to be a steady 27-29% of re-arrests within the first 12 months. What is it that brings ex-offenders back to prison? This is a question that has troubled the commonwealth for a long while.</p>
            <p>So just for some context, I am an ex-offender, so I have a bit of an inside perspective. At the same time I know my perspective is mot absolute, so I wanted to get together some friends of mine who are also ex-offenders and see if I could get their perspectives. It would be eye-opening to see what they recognize as triggers or positive influences. I want to discuss a few topics covering how offenders prepare for success prior to being released. I wonder whether it may come down to poor planning sometimes. I want to find out if offenders have faith in the tool that the penile system offers. Is it poor support systems maybe? This site will explore the viewpoints of three of my friends: Tim Sisson, Willie Woskie, and Rachael Bull.</p><p>Read the next chapter<a href="past.html" class="fun"> here.</a></p></section>
