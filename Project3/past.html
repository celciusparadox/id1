            <p>One of the main issues that always comes up for ex-offenders is the past. How does someone who has done so much to prove that they are always headed down a dark path, escape it. thsi is one of the points that each of the people I interviewed brought up. The past. why wont anyone forget the past? Why wont anyone believe that mY past is behind me...an old skin to be cast aside? Why isnt it easy to convince people that I want to do the right thing? The answers to these questions are not so black and white. There have been, in many cassesw, years and years of proving the exact opposite, so it will not be easy. Many of the ex-offenders I had the pleasure of speaking with have figured out a way to overcome those doubts.</p>
            <p>Most offenders are career criminals. That is a fact. "Very few people are sentanced to prison time on their first offense. They recieve city jail tyime and probation. THat is how they get you. Everytimje you mess up at all you are given a portion of the time over your head. it can take around five years to kill a two year sentance. And even then you are not free", says Celcius Paradox, one of my interviewees. this seems to be the sentiment among most of the ex-offenders I spoke with.</p><p>The fact that these same offenders often spoke of committing crimes even as juveniles seems to escape them. It seems that every wrong done by them to others.. friends and family included is not considered during the worst of times. Only when an offender has time to sit and think about what they have done to others does it seem to sink in. Alot of the offenders I sp[oke to were well aware of how they have wronged people. They justb want to have another chance at life, at friendships, family bonds , anmd careers.</p>
